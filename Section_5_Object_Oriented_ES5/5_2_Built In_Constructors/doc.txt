In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

///////////////////////

** JavaScript Primitives ** 
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

 - string
 - number
 - boolean
 - null
 - undefined

สร้าง Object มี 4 วิธี

Creating a JavaScript Object
With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

There are different ways to create new objects:

- Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
const bas = {name : 'Teeruch', age : 26};

- Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
const bas = new Object({{name : 'Teeruch', age : 26}});

- Define an * object constructor* , and then create objects of the constructed type.
function Person(name,age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
};

const bas = Person('Bas',26);

In ECMAScript 5, an object can also be created with the function Object.create().
